# 🔄 Data Preparation Process

The data preparation workflow included:

## 1. Data Loading

* Imported raw CSV dataset
* Loaded data into MySQL for data exploration
* Connected cleaned data to Power BI

## 2. Data Cleaning

Performed data quality checks:

* Checked missing values
* Verified column data types

---

# 📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The dashboard includes the following business metrics:

---

## Total Sales

Measures total revenue generated.

```DAX
Total Sales = SUM(SampleSuperstore[sales])
```

---

## Total Profit

Measures total profit generated.

```DAX
Total Profit = SUM(SampleSuperstore[profit])
```

---

## Profit Margin

Measures profitability efficiency.

```DAX
Profit Margin =
DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales], 0)
```

---

## Total Orders

Counts total transactions.

```DAX
Total Orders =
COUNTROWS(SampleSuperstore)
```

---

## Average Order Value (AOV)

Measures average revenue generated per transaction.

```DAX
AOV =
DIVIDE([Total Sales], [Total Orders], 0)
```

# 📊 Dashboard Overview

The Power BI report contains three analytical dashboards.

---

# 1️⃣ Executive Overview Dashboard

## Objective

Provide a high-level overview of business performance.

## Main Visualizations:

### KPI Cards

* Total Sales
* Total Profit
* Profit Margin
* Total Orders
* Average Order Value

### Sales Performance by Region

Analyzes revenue distribution across different regions.

### Profit Analysis by Category

Identifies the most profitable product categories.

### Sales vs Profit Analysis

Analyzes the relationship between sales performance and profitability across sub-categories.

This helps identify:

* High sales and high profit segments
* High sales but low profitability areas

---

# 2️⃣ Product Analysis Dashboard

## Objective

Analyze product category performance and profitability.

## Main Visualizations:

### Sales by Category

Identifies categories generating the highest revenue.

### Profitability by Sub-Category

Highlights:

* Most profitable sub-categories
* Loss-making sub-categories

### Sales vs Profit Relationship

Evaluates whether high sales volumes generate proportional profits.

### Discount Impact Analysis

Analyzes how discount levels affect profitability.

---

# 3️⃣ Customer & Regional Analysis Dashboard

## Objective

Understand geographic performance and customer segment behavior.

## Main Visualizations:

### Profit by Region

Identifies regional profitability differences.

### Customer Segment Performance

Analyzes performance of:

* Consumer
* Corporate
* Home Office

### Geographic Sales Analysis

Explores sales distribution by:

* State
* City

---

# 💡 Business Insights

The analysis provides several business insights:

* High sales volume does not always result in high profitability.
* Some product sub-categories generate significant revenue but lower profit margins.
* Discount strategies can negatively impact profitability when not optimized.
* Different customer segments have different purchasing behaviors.
* Regional performance varies and requires targeted business strategies.
* Profit analysis provides better decision-making insights than sales analysis alone.
